# Angular clientside code for GoogleMapsRouteTracker

To use this app, you'll need to generate an ssl key and certificate, and insert your maps js api key into index.html
Use mkcert to generate an ssl: make ssl folder in root of client folder
install mkcert, and run this in terminal:
mkcert -cert-file ssl/local-cert.pem -key-file ssl/local-key.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 192.168.1.109 172.18.0.1 ::1
to run server, use: ng serve --ssl true --ssl-cert ./ssl/local-cert.pem --ssl-key ./ssl/local-key.pem
to enable usage of js maps/ places, in your index html, add this below link rel=icon:
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOURAPAIKEYHERE&callback=Function.prototype&libraries=places"></script>

app is structured with pages, components that are rendered by pages/ other components, an interface for receiving routes from server,
pipe to convert a routes seconds to hours/mins
services to validate input before sending to server, upload routes, and handle socket io event handling

workflow- user is on a page, checkSession will run, which will call AuthService. That will make an api request to the flask server, which will return if hte user is logged in or not
on the response, it will set logged in to true or false, and alter the navbar. if youre on the main page, it will send you back to home

navbar- changes based on if user is logged in or not. has ability to make logout request when clicked, and has a demo button which uses a sample account to login

login/register- checks session, if not logged in, stay on page, otherwise redirects to /main
once username/password is filled out, and submit is clicked, input validation service runs, checking if username/password are alphanumerical and appropriate len
if it works, api request is made to server, and listens for response. if that works, redirected to main, otherwise display error msg

main- checks session on init, and redirects if not signed in, otherwise gets routes from server and sets username. establishes socket io connection w/ server using socket service. this reloads current user routes when receiving message from server
it renders create-route component, which is shown when create route is clicked. this component is used to create a route. routes require a valid routename, fromlocation address,
toLocation address, fromPlaceid, and toPlaceid, and valid hours/minutes data. the addresses and placeids are established in the map component, which is rendered by create route form
the map component renders a google map, and search fields for places. when a valid place is selected for from/to, it will establish respective placeids/location addresses
when the submission is sent, this data is checked if its valid clientside, and then submitted to the server if successful
getRoutes is used to pull the user's routes from the db. it abides by interface Route in interfaces/route. route displays routename, route addresses, googlem aps url, the desired route time in hh/mm, and the actual route time based on google maps api. 
delete route is used to delete a users route based on the route id from server. makes req to delete once clicked

services: authService makes login, register, checkSession, and logout reqs to server and returns data based on response
input-validation: verifies route submission before server submission
route-service: handles route creation, getting, and deletion requests to server
socket-service: handles socket emission from server, detects if reloadRoutes has been emitted from server
pipe: converts seconds from route property to hh/mm to be displayed
